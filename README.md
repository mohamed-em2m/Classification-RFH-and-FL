**1. Project Overview**

This project implements a multimodal artificial intelligence pipeline for the classification of Reactive Follicular Hyperplasia (RFH) and Follicular Lymphoma (FL).
The framework integrates histopathological image patches, cell-level representations, spatial cell–cell relationships, clinicopathological data, and nuclear morphometric features.

The pipeline combines:
Traditional machine learning (XGBoost with SHAP),
Deep learning (CNNs + multilayer perceptron),
Vision Transformer–based cell modelling (CellViT++),
Graph Neural Networks for spatial analysis (Cell-GNN),
Explainable AI methods (Grad-CAM).
The system is intended for research and proof-of-concept use in computational pathology.

•	XGBoost + SHAP (clinicopathological and morphometric modelling)

•	U-Net++ (tissue-level segmentation for patch extraction)

•	AlexNet + Multilayer Perceptron (multimodal fusion)

•	VGG16 + Multilayer Perceptron (multimodal fusion)

•	ResNet18 + Multilayer Perceptron (multimodal fusion)

**11. Compliance with TRIPOD-AI and CLAIM 2024 Guidelines**

This repository has been structured to meet the TRIPOD-AI (Transparent Reporting of a multivariable prediction model for Individual Prognosis Or Diagnosis – 
AI extension) and CLAIM 2024 (Checklist for Artificial Intelligence in Medical Imaging) requirements for transparent and reproducible AI in healthcare.

**Data Source and Splits**

Detailed in README.md → Dataset Organization and METHODS.md.
Data divided into 80% training, 10% validation, and 10% testing.
Two independent external validation cohorts used to assess generalizability.

**Model Architecture and Training**

Documented in /models and individual training scripts.
Includes optimizer (AdamW), learning rate, batch size, epochs, and loss functions.

**Performance Metrics**

Internal and external validation results summarized in /results
Cross-institutional evaluation demonstrates robustness to domain shifts.
